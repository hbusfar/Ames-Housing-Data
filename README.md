# Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge

## Introduction

Project two provides data for the prices of 2051 houses in Ames, IA. There are 80 different parameters (Indep variables) that determine the prices of these homes. In this project we analyze the data and find the best model that predicts the prices of these houses. The data files are a .csv files along with a Jupyter notebook which describes the data with visualizations & statistical analysis. A PDF of the presentation is also included in project 2 folder.

## Problem Statement:

We want to be able to predict the price of a house at sale using the given dataset. 


## Executive Summary:

There are 80 different factors that determine the price of a house at sale. Many of these factors do not correlate highly with the price of a house. We found that certain factors such as the overall material and finish of the house, the ground area and the garage area affect the prices of houses at sale.
